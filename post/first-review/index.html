          <p>Hugo, a fast and modern static site engine. When I first heard of it, it seems like a good idea. It still is! But after using it you quickly realise its not as perfect as it seems. You quickly realise that Hugo is built for the more tech savy users and lack any form of guidance for those less tech savvy. No doubt they have a great documentation, but users nowadays are too impatient to flip through pages of documentation to get their first site up. A lack of user interface also means that user have to pick up the command line and also learn a little bit of programming to customize their page. Other CMS like the wordpress are so intuitive that user can get by without ever learning how to code.</p>

<p>Hugo is fast. Not having dynamic content means we can use the HTTP server for what it is meant to do - focus on delivering content. The website boast that a page with 5000 posts can be loaded in seconds. Furthermore, being a static site, you will be able to find host very easily. This will also help to cut down your cost as static site host are usually much cheaper than host that support other kind of server technologies.</p>

<p>Customizability is also there if you know some basic programming. You can also easily customize all parts of Hugo to make it create the perfect site that you want. But that is the catch, you really need to know programming. If you do not know, then there is no user interface that can help you to customize it easily. But I suppose there are a great number of themes that can be easily downloaded and placed in your themes folder.</p>

<p>It definitely feels good to be able to edit your post offline using your favourite text editor. Even notepad if that is your kind of thing. But the truth is, I kind of miss all the tools that wordpress provides. Eg I can easily attached an image by clicking on the add the image button. As for Hugo, actually I do not know how to attach an image here. I tried to do alittle bit of formatting such as making a list, but I have to search online on how to use markdown to format my page. Granted that markdown is pretty easy to learn, but I just kind of miss the great user interface provided by wordpress.</p>

<p>No doubt it takes a different approach to the modern web development but we must also realise that not everyone is a coder. If speed is really your utmost importance, then by all means, Hugo is definitely the right way to go. However, if you want to be able to edit your post easily, using the great many tools that allows you to tag, attach images without learning how to code, then you are better off using something else such as Wordpress.</p>

<p><strong>Pros :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fast Delivery</li>
<li>Easy to find host, its just a simple static websie</li>
<li>High Customizability</li>
<li>Able to do editing offline</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Needs to be proficient and comfortable with using the command line, Markdown</li>
<li>Not as intuitive to set up as compared to eg Wordpress</li>
</ul>

      <h2 class="title">A new way of Web development</h2>
      <div class="summary">In this post, I will write about my thoughts on generating site using Hugo as a web developer.
Firstly, I have not used Hugo much but it seems like if you know how to customize it, you can really use it to make all sorts of website.
In terms of the value of the site, it seems like sites generated using hugo will be hard to sell due to the poor usability of the tool.</div>

      <div class="summary">This is the first post for this hugo blog. I find the concept very smart and interesting. Even though it was supposed to be a technique that was used since the 1990s. I guess I am probaby just too used to the modern way of doing things.</div>
